            <dd><b>AIR POLLUTION MONITORING SYSTEM FOR CAMPUS WALKABILITY</b> is a project developed by Computer Engineering students of <a href="https://www.https://www.mvgrce.com/">MVGR</a>college<br>
                <a href="https://www.mvgrce.com/departments/cse">Department of CSE</a>
                to evaluate the walkability in the campus, through analysis of temperature, humidity and particulate matter levels.<br></dd>
            <dt><h3>Problem statement</h3></dt>
            <dd>
                The level of pollution is increasing rapidly due to factors like industries, urbanization, increase in population, vehicle use which can affect human health.
                <br> This presents real-time standalone air quality monitoring. Internet of Things (IoT) is nowadays finding profound use in each and every sector, plays a key
                <br> role in our air quality monitoring system too. The setup will show the air quality in PPM on the webpage so that we can monitor it very easily

            <dd>
                Air pollution is one of the biggest threats to the present-day environment. Everyone is being  affected by air pollution day by day including humans, animals,
                <br>crops, cities, forests and aquatic ecosystems.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                Besides that, it should be controlled at a certain level to prevent the increasing rate of global warming.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                This project aims to design an IOT-based air pollution monitoring system to monitor the air quality of the surroundings and environment using the internet from 
                <br>anywhere using a computer or mobile.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                By using this device we can monitor air and pollution and also humidity.
